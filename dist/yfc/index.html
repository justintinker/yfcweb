        <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Every year, a group of committed and engaged high school students meet to plan and produce City Club forums for other high school students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Members of the Youth Forum Council come from a number of area high schools and they meet regularly to determine the topics and invite the speakers for as many as five forums each year. After that, they run the show, handling all logistics of each program. Our Youth Forum provides a unique opportunity for participants to develop effective communication skills by holding group discussions on current events and public affairs at Forums, develop analytical thinking abilities by debating the topic and points of view reflected by the Forum speaker, and encouraging positive community involvement by providing a direct experience with engaged dialogueâ€”the very fiber of American democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, the Youth Forum Series has covered a number of important topics ranging from affirmative action to international relations. The Forums are always timely and invigorating. Speakers have included Cleveland Mayor Jane Campbell, Greenpeace Executive Director John Passacantando, and former Special Envoy to Afghanistan Peter Tomsen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students interested in local and national issues, have diverse points of view, enjoy team projects, and want leadership opportunities are encouraged to join the Youth Forum Council.

  It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood.
